Introduction
============

The primary way of constructing DAGs in Airflow is by describing them
in Python: `<https://airflow.apache.org/tutorial.html>`_.

`airflow_declarative` transforms the DAGs defined with YAML to their
Python equivalents.

The public API is pretty simple: there are just 2 functions, both
returning the :class:`airflow.models.DAG` instances:

.. autofunction:: airflow_declarative.from_path

.. autofunction:: airflow_declarative.from_dict
