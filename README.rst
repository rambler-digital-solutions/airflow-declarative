===================
airflow-declarative
===================

Airflow declarative DAGs via YAML.

Compatibility:

- Python 3.9+
- Airflow 2+

Key Features
============

- Declarative DAGs in plain text YAML helps a lot to understand how DAG will
  looks like. Made for humans, not programmers.
- It makes extremely hard to turn your DAGs into code mess. Even if you make
  complicated YAMLs generator the result would be readable for humans.
- No more guilty about coupling business logic with task management system
  (Airflow). They now could coexists separated.
- Static analysis becomes a trivial task.
- It's a good abstraction to create your own scheduler/worker compatible with
  original Airflow one.

Examples
========

Check `tests/dags` directory for example of DAGs which will works and which
won't. Use `src/airflow_declarative/schema.py` module for the reference about
YAML file schema. It should be self descriptive.

Don't be shy to experiment: `trafaret-config`_ will help you to understand
what had gone wrong and why and where.

.. _trafaret-config: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/trafaret-config

Usage
=====

We provide support for two installation options:

1. As a complementary side package for the upstream Airflow.
2. As a built-in Airflow functionality using patches for Airflow.

Upstream Airflow
----------------

The idea is to put a Python script to the ``dags_folder`` which would
load the declarative dags via airflow_declarative. More details:
`Installation using Upstream Airflow`_.

.. code-block:: python

    import os

    import airflow_declarative

    # Assuming that the yaml dags are located in the same directory
    # as this Python module:
    root = os.path.dirname(__file__)

    dags_list = [
        airflow_declarative.from_path(os.path.join(root, item))
        for item in os.listdir(root)
        if item.endswith((".yml", ".yaml"))
    ]

    globals().update({dag.dag_id: dag for dags in dags_list for dag in dags})


Patched Airflow
---------------

We provide ready to use patches in the `patches`_ directory. To use them
you will need to apply a patch to a corresponding Airflow version and then
build it yourself. More details: `Installation using Patched Airflow`_.
